# HamburgerOrderingSystem
The above project is about Hamburger Order System which allows customer to make their orders and payment through the system. We have added necessary features into the system such as add cart, add quantity, choice of payment and enter voucher codes, print receipts and record total orders.
For the tools I used to build this system, I have used mainly Java and CSS. I hope that this project will benefit other developers to have an idea on creating a ordering system.
I have created two versions of the food ordering system. The first version is in the Testtt.zip and the second version is in Testttt.zip. The photos below show the bothe versions of login pages.
